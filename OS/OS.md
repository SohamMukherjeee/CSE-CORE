# Operating System Notes for Placements

---

## 1. Basics & Fundamentals (Medium, Theory)

### üìò Theory

- **Operating System (OS):** Software that manages hardware and software resources, acts as an interface between user and hardware.
- **Functions:** Process management, memory management, file management, I/O management, and security.
- **Types of OS:** Batch, Multiprogramming, Multitasking, Real-time, Distributed.

```
Batch OS ‚Üí Executes jobs in batches, no user interaction.

Multiprogramming OS ‚Üí Runs multiple programs in memory, CPU never idle.

Multitasking OS ‚Üí Allows single user to perform multiple tasks at once.

RTOS ‚Üí Provides immediate response for critical tasks.

Distributed OS ‚Üí Multiple computers work together as one system.
```

- **System Calls:** Mechanism for user programs to request services from OS (e.g., `fork()`, `exec()`, `read()`).
- **Kernel vs User Space:** Kernel space = core privileged code; User space = application programs.

### üìñ Theory Questions

1. Define an Operating System. List its main functions.
2. Differentiate between Kernel space and User space.
3. What are system calls? Give two examples.

## 2. Process Management (Important, Theory + Some Problems)

### üìò Theory

- **Process:** A program in execution (active entity).
- **Thread:** Smallest unit of CPU execution, lightweight compared to process.
- **Process States:** New ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Waiting ‚Üí Terminated.

- **CPU-bound vs I/O-bound:** CPU-bound needs more computation; I/O-bound waits more for I/O.

### CPU Scheduling

- A process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O execution.
- Normally, every process begins with a CPU burst that may be followed by an I/O burst, then another CPU burst and then I/O burst, and so on. Eventually, in the last, it will end up on a CPU burst.

## CPU Bound Process

There are those processes which require most of the time on CPU.

## I/O Bound Process

There are those processes which require most of the time on I/O devices or peripherals.

## Conclusion

A good CPU scheduling idea should choose the mixture of both so that both I/O devices and CPU can be utilized efficiently.

## 3. CPU Scheduling (Important, Problem-Solving)

### üìò Theory

- **CPU Scheduling:** CPU Scheduling is the method used by the operating system to decide which process from
  the ready queue should be executed by the CPU next when multiple processes are waiting.

## Why CPU Scheduling is Needed?

- In a multiprogramming system, there are always more processes than CPUs.

- The CPU must be kept as busy as possible.

- If the CPU is idle while processes are waiting, system performance drops.

- CPU scheduling ensures fairness, efficiency, and responsiveness.

### **Criteria:** Waiting time, Turnaround time, Throughput, CPU utilization, Fairness.
